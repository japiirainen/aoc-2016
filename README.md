# aoc-2016

Advent of code 2016 solutions. I'm planning to complete each problem in a different language. I guess only time will tell how this ends up going.

In particular I'd like to also use languages that are not yet familiar to me.

Language ideas:
- Java
- Racket
- Zig
- Agda
- Common Lisp
- Standard ML
- Kotlin
- Clojure via babashka
- Haskell
- C

## Running

All days are runnable via `make`.

```sh
cd day<xx> && make run
```

| Day | Language    | Link            |
| --- | ----------- | --------------- |
| 01  | Java        | [link](./day01) |
| 02  | Common Lisp | [link](./day02) |
